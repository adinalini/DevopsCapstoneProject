### LEARNING
 
I ran into a little too many errors during this project, not the most fun but I definitely learnt a lot! I tried making a project with Rolling deployment before this one [Repo](https://github.com/adinalini/DevopsCapstoneProject-2), but couldn't resolve the errors there, so finally tried out the Blue/Green and it worked! Can't wait to try out my skills in a real world project.
