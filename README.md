### LEARNING
 
I ran into a little too many errors during this project, not the most fun but I definitely learnt a lot! I tried making a project with Rolling deployment before this one [Repo](https://github.com/adinalini/DevopsCapstoneProject-2), but couldn't resolve the errors there, so finally tried out the Blue/Green and it worked! Can't wait to try out my skills in a real world project.

## HOW TO REPLICATE THIS PROJECT

Go to [Sourcecode](https://github.com/adinalini/DevopsCapstoneProject/tree/master/SourceCode) folder, there you will find the instructions and screenshots for all stages.
