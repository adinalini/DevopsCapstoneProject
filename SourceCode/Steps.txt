4. Open terminal, use chmod 400 keypair.pem and ssh into the EC2 instance (Screenshot 02).

5. Setup a virtual environment (You might need to install python3 first).

> python3 -m venv ~/.capstone
> source ~/.capstone/bin/activate

6. Clone my repo:

   i. First set up ssh keys
   > ssh-keygen -t rsa

   Use  > cat path_to_pub_printed

   ii. Open github, create new repo and go to settings -> SSH keys and add the contents on the above file.
